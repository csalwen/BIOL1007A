## Weekly Assignment 2
```{r}

# I didn't have default values, just the variable name
func <- function(mean1 = 10, sd1 = 1.5, mean2 = 45, sd2 = 2.5){
  # I didn't put n in the arguments meaning it is less reproducible
  Type <- rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), each = 25)
  Value <- c(rnorm(25, mean = mean1, sd = sd1), rnorm(25, mean = mean2, sd = sd2)) # had the set values in here not the argument, now it works for different values
  dframe <- data.frame(Type = Type, Value = Value)
  return(dframe)
  
}
funcdata = func(mean1 = 2, sd1 = 1.5, mean2 = 13, sd2 = 2)

head(funcdata)

results <- aov(Value ~ Type, data = funcdata)
# didn't write a function for this, but I think both ways are fine
summary(results)


func2 <- function(data_frame = NULL){ # didn't put a default value
  test <- aov(data_frame[,1] ~ data_frame[,2], data = data_frame) # didn't use the column names -- that would be cleaner
  all_stats <- summary(test)
  p_value <- all_stats[1,5]
  return(p_value)
}
```


## Assignment 6:
Our code looks very similar for this assignment. There are a couple tiny things I could've done to be more efficient, but overall they work the same. For example, I could have used the %in% operator on question 2 instead of saying : Species == "versicolor"|Species == "virginica".
