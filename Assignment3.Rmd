### Question 1
```{r}
x <- 1.1
a <- 2.2
b <- 3.3

z <- x^a^b
print(z)

z <- (x^a)^b
print(z)

z <- 3*x^3 + 2*x^2 + 1 
print(z)
```

### Question 2
```{r}
first <- c(seq(from = 1, to = 8), seq(from = 7, to = 1)) 

b <- rep(x = 1:5)
second <- rep(x = 1:5, times = b)

c <- rep(x = 1:5)
third <- rep(x = 5:1, times = c)

```

### Question 3
```{r}
queue <- c("sheep", "fox", "owl", "ant")
queue <- c(queue[1:4], "serpent")
queue <- c(queue[2:5])
queue <- c("donkey", queue[1:4])
queue <- c(queue[1:4])
queue <- append(queue, "aphid", after = 3)
# which(queue,"aphid")
```
